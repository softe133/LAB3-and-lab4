Lack of education leaves society backward and regressive. A nation can be progressive when education is accessible to all without any discrimination. All citizens have rights and responsibilities provided by the State. Education makes the people aware of both their rights and responsibilities. The equitable sharing of the nationâ€™s wealth also depends on the free and universal access to education to all the citizens.</p></div>
